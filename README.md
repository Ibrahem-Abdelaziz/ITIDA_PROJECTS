Tooling Projects on Make And CMake

Create two projects: one using a Makefile for build automation and the other using CMake for generating a professional Makefile. Both projects will implement a snake effect using 8 LEDs on an ATmega32 microcontroller 500 msec.

Project 1: Using Makefile for Build Automation 

Folder Structure:

- project_folder
  - Inc
    - LSTD_Types.h
    - LBit_Math.h
  - Lib
    - DIO_prog.c
    - DIO_int.h
    - DIO_priv.h
    - Makefile (for generating LibDIO.a)
  - src
    - main.c (snake effect implementation for 8 LEDs)
  - Makefile (for building snake_effect.elf and snake_effect.hex)
  - build (directory to store build output files)
    - snake_effect.elf
    - snake_effect.hex
    - binaryReport.txt
  
Project Description:
This project aims to implement a snake effect using 8 LEDs connected to an ATmega32 microcontroller.The project uses a custom static Library LibDIO.a generated by the Makefile inside the Lib folder. The build process creates snake_effect.elf and snake_effect.hex files and generates a binaryReport.txt containing build information.

Build Process:

The Makefile in the Lib folder generates LibDIO.a from DIO_prog.c, DIO_int.h, DIO_priv.h, and DIO_Config.h.
The main Makefile compiles main.c along with LibDIO.a to generate snake_effect.elf.
avr-objcopy converts snake_effect.elf to snake_effect.hex.
The build output files (snake_effect.elf, snake_effect.hex, and binaryReport.txt) are placed in the build directory.


Project 2: Using CMake for Professional Makefile Generation

Folder Structure:
- project_folder
  - Inc
    - LSTD_Types.h
    - LBit_Math.h
  - Lib
    - DIO_prog.c
    - DIO_int.h
    - DIO_priv.h
    - CMakeLists.txt (for generating LibDIO.a)
  - src
    - main.c (snake effect implementation for 8 LEDs)
  - CMakeLists.txt (for generating professional Makefile)
  - build (directory to store build output files)
    - snake_effect.elf
    - snake_effect.hex
    - binaryReport.txt




Project Description:
This project implements the snake effect using 8 LEDs on an ATmega32 microcontroller. It utilizes CMake for generating both the professional Makefile and the static Library LibDIO.a. The CMakeLists.txt file inside the Lib directory configures the generation of LibDIO.a . The main CMakeLists.txt file in the project root configures the entire project, Including the Library.

Build Process:
Inside the Lib directory: CMake generates a Makefile for DIO_prog.c, DIO_int.h, DIO_priv.h, and DIO_Config.h.
The generated Makefile compiles these files into LibDIO.a.
In the project root: CMake generates a professional Makefile based on the configuration in the root CMakeLists.txt.
The build output files (snake_effect.elf, snake_effect.hex, and binaryReport.txt) are placed in the build directory.
